### Hi there! I'm an AI Solutions Architect & MarTech Engineer. 🐺

I sit at the intersection of **Enterprise AI**, **Workflow Orchestration**, and **Strategic Marketing**.

With 17 years of experience in Strategy and a pivot to Software Engineering, I don't just "deploy chatbots." I architect **hallucination-resistant AI Agents** and **automated data pipelines** that drive revenue and enforce business governance.

I am a **Salesforce Certified AI Associate** specializing in translating complex business logic into secure, scalable technical solutions.
